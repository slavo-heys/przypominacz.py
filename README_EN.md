The *** Reminder *** program is intended for children and teenagers. The program's task is to display the timetable, extracurricular activities, 
and to remind you of important reminders of important events: name days, birthdays, etc.

The following packages are necessary for the correct operation of the programs:

* Python3
* Tkinter
* strftime
* Path
* Menu
* sqlite3
* datetime

If there are no packages, you need to install them manually. The program undoubtedly works on Ubuntu20. I have not run tests on other systems.

**What's in the future?**
The program will grow with my programming learning progress. At the moment, I plan to add a diary module. Every young man once had a paper diary, 
especially little girls. The diary was to serve as a bank of ideas and events that young people never told their guardians about. Now such a diary 
will be in electronic form.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I encourage you to download the program and test. Just copy the code to notepad, name the file and change txt to py after the dot. 
The Linux program should start immediately. Otherwise, install the above-mentioned packages starting with Python3. How to do it? 
Everything can be found on the internet. Soon I will write instructions for installing the above packages (this knowledge will be especially for those 
who have no idea about it.)

**Donation**
If you want to support me financially, thank you very much in advance. I am collecting for a newer computer with a larger monitor, which will make my 
learning much easier.
I would also like to set up a page where you can download my programs and read about news in the programs I have written so far. 
Unfortunately, the cost of such a server and its maintenance is not small. I cannot afford to support it on my pension.
